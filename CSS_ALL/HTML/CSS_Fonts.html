    Weapons</hr></h1>
<p>A <b>weapon</b>, arm or <i>armament</i> is any implement or device that can be used to inflict physical damage<br>,
    harm or kill. Weapons are used to increase the efficacy and efficiency<br> of activities such as hunting, crime, law
    enforcement, self-defense, and warfare, as well as murder or suicide. In broader context, weapons may be construed
    to include anything used to gain a tactical, strategic, material or mental advantage over an adversary or enemy
    target.</p>
<p>While <span>ordinary objects</span> – sticks, rocks, bottles, chairs, vehicles – can be used as weapons, many are
    expressly designed for the purpose; these range from simple implements such as clubs, axes and swords, to
    complicated modern firearms, tanks, intercontinental ballistic missiles, biological weapons, and cyberweapons.
    Something that has been re-purposed, converted, or enhanced to become a weapon of war is termed weaponized, such as
    a weaponized virus or weaponized laser.</p>
<h2><u>History</u></h2>
<p>The use of weapons is a major driver of cultural evolution and human history up to today, since weapons are a type of
    tool which is used to dominate and subdue autonomous agents such as animals and by that allow for an expansion of
    the cultural niche, while simultaneously other weapon users (i.e., agents such as humans, groups, cultures) are able
    to adapt to weapons of enemies by learning, triggering a continuous process of competitive technological, skill and
    cognitive improvement (arms race).</p>
<h2>Types of weapons</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SALW">Personal weapons</a> (or small arms) – designed to be used by a
        single person.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SALW">Light weapons</a> – 'man-portable' weapons that may require a small
        team to operate
    </li>
</ul>
